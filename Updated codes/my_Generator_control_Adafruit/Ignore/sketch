stop worry this for now
---------------------------------------
1. test the motor spin at the condition

want to have motor running

want sequence of ignition procedure
1. warm up
close choke
high throttle
wait 1.5s
motor running slowly a 20-30 percent
wait .5s? tentative
//gas gets rich and likely engine starts running weakly

2. (closing choke)

motor running slowly a 20-30 percent
slowly open the choke till half open (maybe the condition is actually RPM)
lower throttle to half

3. (set throttle)

//likely the engine is already kinda started


4. (make throttle tied)
enginer normal running

5. after ignition/started, want to be able to 
1. change throttle 
2. stop esc and throttle

-------------------
gonna just use what was there
1.warm up
close choke fully
high throttle fully
wait 1.5s
motor running slowly a 20-30 percent
wait .5s? tentative

2.
motor running slowly a 20-30 percent
choke half
throttle half
wait 0.5s

3.
motor running slowly a 20-30 percent
choke half
throttle 65%
wait 0.5s

4. idle 1
motor idle 10%?
choke half
throttle 65%
wait 0.5s

5. idle 2
motor completely idle 0%
choke half
throttle 65%

maybe also want throttle controllable

6. stop
motor 0
choke fully open
throttle fully 0



other circuits
---------------------------------------
sparks circuit

load circuit

1. connect the load, verify the load, figure out the switches

2. get the current sensor working

----------------------------------------
run an esc test and a servo test seperately
