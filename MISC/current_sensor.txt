current sensor

current (A) 	Voltage 
0				1.603
5				1.571
10				1.537
-10				1.674

6.6mV/A

Full scale of IP applied for 5 ms, TA = 25°C – 6.6 – mV/A
Full scale of IP applied for 5 ms, TOP = 25°C to 85°C - 6.7 – mV/A

3.3V 			752-753		673.5
1.603V/1.608 	370			326
1.674			385/386

4.9 is unit mv in arduino analog read
6.6 is the sensitivity given by the datasheet and verified by experiments
